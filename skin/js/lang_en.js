        feature_1: 'The relationship between cannabis and humans is more closely related to any other plant known in the universe. The human body not only synthesizes endocannabinoids by itself, but also has two cannabinoid receptors. The endocannabinoid system is a system that interacts with the cannabinoid receptors in our body. The endogenous cannabinoid produced by the system has a very similar three-dimensional structure to the main component of cannabis, THC, which acts on the protection of the nervous system. It can determine the survival of neurons, and the CBD can directly interact with the endocannabinoid system in our body. Two major receptor types have been identified: CB1 and CB2, which are the most prevalent and important cellular receptors in every mammal on the planet, and cannabinoid receptor agonists act on Gi/o Protein promotes the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK regulates transcription, translation, synaptic vesicle fusion, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The study found that excitation of the CB1 receptor in the striatum and hippocampus activates ERK and leads to phosphorylation of its downstream transcription factors, and activation of these signaling pathways can protect cells. The cell\'s antioxidant capacity enhances and inhibits free radicals generated by continuous contact with the outside world, delays the rate of degeneration and prevents skin aging. The powerful properties of CBD open a new path for the development of cell engineering and medicine. A revolutionary pioneering work in the field of health.',
        feature_2: 'The hemp oil is very special because it contains two essential fatty acids that are not synthesized by itself: α-linoleic acid (Omega-3fatty acid) and linoleic acid (Omega-6 fatty acid) and are very high in content. In particular, the amount of Omega-3 fatty acids can even reach several times that of fish oil. In addition to high-quality fatty acids, Hemp oil also contains abundant protein species, including all 20 known amino acids, as well as cellulosics, minerals and vitamin B Group that can provide the most effective anti-aging, anti-oxidation and autoimmune effects, along with other organic pure compounds, it also offers the most natural care for the skin, increase the oxygen carrying capacity of somatic cells, and make our skin, hair and eyes glower than ever. Hemp oil’s rich and diverse nutritional structure determines its comprehensiveness in skin care and the unlimited potential to be developed.'
